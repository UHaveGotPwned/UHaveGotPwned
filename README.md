# UHaveGotPwned

Hello everybody. Im UHaveGotPwned but you can call me π.

I work as a C++ and Typescript programmer. I spend my free time learning hacking, how to analize and write malware and programming bullshit.

I like both sides of pentesting: server-side and client-side. At the moment i have more practice with the client-side but is all time and practice m8. Talking about malware, i like the analisys part and trying to understand how the malware works. I like to understand how all works, thats why i love hacking. Its all about understanding, finding things that usually nobody sees and thinking out-the-box stuff. Serious bussiness. Anyway, i build malware just for fun. I believe a good hacker must know how to the systems and defenses works to try to find some vulnerability. Learn to exploit.

I do not have much to say, idk what kinds of projects u will find in this profile but take a look and hf ;)
